# Regular expression
A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command).

## Learning objectives
For this project, we have to build regular expressions using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which isused by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties. The focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex)

## Requirments
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library
